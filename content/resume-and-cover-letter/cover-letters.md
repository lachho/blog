Cover Letters are an Advanced English level discursive writing with 2 questions to answer:



* Why this company?
* Why pick me?

The best cover letters will answer those two questions with the most conviction with the fewest amount of words. Competition is fierce and your cover needs to stand out. 

How do we do that?

Tailor. Tailor. Tailor. 


## Step 1. Show your Passion

Enthusiasm speaks volumes. Start your letters with a targeted introduction explaining what drew you to this specific company. Skills can be taught but a culture match is hard to come by. Show that you’re not just looking for any job, but genuinely interested in this specific company, not anywhere else. Mention any networking events, workshops or interactions you’ve had with the company to demonstrate your commitment. 

Even if you're applying to many places, write as if this is the ONLY role you want. If you want them to pick you out of all the applicants, you’ve got to convey you’d pick them out of all the companies. 


## Step 2. Align with the Job Description.

Resumes, you could probably get away without a pretty stock standard resume. This won’t fly with cover letters. Take the time to research the role you are applying for. Look for key phrases, skills and words in the job description and weave them into your letter. Use the specific role title, ensure any specific requirements in the job description are addressed. 


## Step 3. Specific Achievements and Skills

Just like resumes, recruiters want to see real examples of real skills with real achievements. Projects, volunteering, internships, jobs. Share specifics about your experiences and relate them back to how they’ve prepped you for this role. Quantify your impact. Numbers = proof. Focus on skills and experiences that are most relevant to the role. Tell your unique story and how your story sets you up for success at the company. 


## Step 4. Align with the Company Values

Research the company itself - see what their “values” are. It’s not enough to just align yourself to be suitable for the job, you need to be suitable for the company. Highlight how you and the company somehow have the exact same core values! Again this shows you took the time to research the company, and will be a perfect fit for the culture, which is a huge component of what recruiters are looking for. 


## Misc Tips



1. For cover letters, it's all about the small touches and attention to detail that show you’ve put in the work and are passionate for the company.
2. Address the letter to a specific person or team. 
3. Keep it short and sweet. One page, 200-400 words. 
4. Proofread. Consider a typo or grammar mistake game over. 
5. Think from the recruiters perspective. Does your cover letter sound passionate and qualified?
6. It's meant to be a letter, so have a subject line, greetings and closing signature.
