Networking is not some scary professional thing. Networking is the biz jargon for just making friends. The best way to  “network” with someone is to ask questions and chat as if you were trying to be their friend. 

People say to go to networking events because you get to:



* Build real world connections and expand your industry network
* Impress the recruiters so much that they remember you and give you a job instantly
* Learn more about companies and allow them to wow you with their corporate jargon

Let’s learn how to network like a pro. 


## Networking Masterclass

Vibe is everything. Speak with confidence, clarify and conviction. Practice removing filler words, eye contact and do not waffle. If you feel confidence, they’ll feel that too. 

Smile and show enthusiasm. If you are interested in them, then they are more likely to be interested in you. If you’re unsure how to build rapport, try follow these tips:



* **Personality mirroring**, whether that be body language, posture, expressions or personality 
* **Open body language**. These are non-verbal cues that signal trust and openness. 
* **Active listening**, using verbal and non-verbal cues. 
* **Maintain eye contact**, but avoid staring. Follow the 50/70 rule. Make eye contact for 50% of the time when speaking, and 70% when listening. 
* **Finding common ground**. Engage in small talk and ask questions about the interviewer you genuinely want to know more about. 
* **Authenticity**. It’s super easy to tell if someone is being insincere and it's a major turn off. 


## Asking Questions

Everyone loves to talk about themselves, whether they realise it or not. Capitalise on this concept by asking about their role and their experiences. Try to do your research about the company and ask specific questions you actually want the answer to. 

Ask questions you actually want the answer to, don’t just zone out after answering. 


## Advice for Introverts

Shy? Awkward? Lacking Confidence? Me too. Networking is hard, but that’s ok. Here are my thoughts for introverts like me to gain some confidence in networking. 

Thousands of people pass through networking events. You are highly unlikely to be ever remembered. Use this to your advantage. Go in, strike up a conversation, and if all goes wrong, who cares? No one will remember. 

Use this opportunity to go outside and touch some grass. Use networking events as practice getting out of your comfort zone and overcome the fear of talking to strangers. I used to be super shy, but through repetition I’ve slowly chipped down that barrier and am more comfortable with talking to strangers. Get confident asking meaningful questions (again by trial and error) and talking about yourself). That way, when you're in an interview (or date idk this applies too), you're prepped, ready and loose. 

It is always good to attend networking events and many unique opportunities have popped up for me just by attending (I was literally offered an internship after attending what was advertised as a “networking event”, which was really a group assessment). 

Networking events are a Pascal’s Wager, the potential rewards are many, and the drawbacks are basically nonexistent.
