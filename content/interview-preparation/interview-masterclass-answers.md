My 2nd biggest tip for interviews, pause. 

You don’t need to answer the question immediately, and interviewers don’t expect that either. 

Take a short pause to process the question, consider your answer and organise your thoughts instead of jumping straight into an answer. 

If you need more time to think, acknowledging the question by repeating it gives you some extra time. 

Anyways, think back to that list of experiences you wrote down and you should be good to go. Aim to structure your responses like an advanced english essay paragraph, with a topic sentence, body and remember to tie your response back to the initial question. 

Longer response does not equal better responses. Likewise, you can generally elaborate on a 1 sentence response with a STAR response example. Stay on topic and answer the question directly. 


## STAR Responses

STAR STAR STAR

The STAR method is the gold standard structure to answer behavioral questions. It has 4 parts:

**Situation**. Describe the context of the situation or event. Set the scene, without spending too much time on this section. 

**Task**. Explain the specific challenge that you were responsible for. 

**Action**. What did you specifically do to address the situation? Focus on your personal contribution and highlight the relevant skills. 

**Result**. What was the outcome of the actions you took and what you achieved? Quantify the results, lessons learnt and tie it back to the question. 


## Asking Questions

Always ask questions! If you don’t understand a question, ask for clarification. It shows initiative and you're not just nodding your head along mindlessly. 

Additionally, always ask questions at the end of the interview. This encapsulates your enthusiasm and desire to learn more about the company and the interviewers. 

Everyone loves to talk about themselves, whether they realise it or not. Capitalise on this concept by asking about their role and their experiences. 

Ask questions you actually want the answer to, don’t just zone out after answering. Think back across the interview and ask about anything that peaked your interest.
