The dreaded interview. You’re so close. If you’ve managed to get to this stage, you’re probably already in the top 1% of applicants. Now just seal the deal. 


## Few Days Before

A few days before the interview, try to get some field work done. Review the job description, learn about the company. Learn the company’s values, recent projects and have a strong why, on why you want to work there. 

It’s worth investing some time into a document where you can note down some recent experiences where you had to showcase different skills and solve different problems. 

Use [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/) to find common interview formats and questions for that company. Otherwise, google common interview questions and try to cover all your bases in that document. This will help you identify areas of weakness and aren’t thrown off by any curveball questions. 

This set of notes should just be dot points, key talking points to remind yourself of what happened. I would recommend against memorising responses, as they will just sound unnatural, and fumble your works due to your nerves. 


## Day Of

Do a few voice warm ups such that the first thing you say isn’t a squeak.

Most importantly, is to not stress. Get a good night's sleep and get energised. Just like any pro athlete or musician has their pre-performance routine, so should you. Whether that be listening to your favourite song, eating/not eating, self-talk or meditating, do what you need to do to calm your nerves, lock in and get into the zone. Visualise success. 


## My Biggest Tip

The fact is, rarely do we ever talk about ourselves like we do in interviews, so obviously we aren’t going to be very good at it. 

So my biggest tip, practice. 

I know you don’t want to hear it, but the best way to get good at interviews is to put in so many hours it would be unreasonable to fail, or at least put in more hours than your peers. 

Get your friends and family to practice with you or even practice in the mirror. 

Apply for roles and take interviews for roles you don’t necessarily want. Use these as free opportunities to practice interviews in a professional environment with strangers.
