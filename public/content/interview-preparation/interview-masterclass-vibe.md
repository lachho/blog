Interviews are not just about what you say, but how you say it. 

Speak with confidence, clarify and conviction. Practice removing filler words, eye contact and do not waffle. More talking does not equal more presentation skills. 

Vibe is everything. Employees know you have no experience and are still in university. Software and hard skills can be taught, vibe, not so much. Smile and show enthusiasm. If you are interested in them, then they are more likely to be interested in you. 

Remember, interviewers are looking for a colleague, someone they will see 5 days a week, every week. They want to pick someone they will get along with. It is important to build rapport throughout the interview. 

Ways to build rapport:

* **Personality mirroring**, whether that be body language, posture, expressions or personality 
* **Open body language**. These are non-verbal cues that signal trust and openness. 
* **Active listening**, using verbal and non-verbal cues. 
* **Maintain eye contact**, but avoid staring. Follow the 50/70 rule. Make eye contact for 50% of the time when speaking, and 70% when listening. 
* **Finding common ground**. Engage in small talk and ask questions about the interviewer you genuinely want to know more about. 
* **Authenticity**. It’s super easy to tell if someone is being insincere and it's a major turn off. 

Other tips:



* Don’t speak too fast. Take your time to think and then answer. 
* Dress professionally and iron your shirt. 
* Make a good first impression.
