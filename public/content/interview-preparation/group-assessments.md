Assessments centres are probably the most fun part of the job application process, in my psychotic opinion. I’d say they are probably the least nerve racking process as well. You’re with a bunch of other ca candidates so the pressure is taken off you to perform at your peak. 

Assessment centres are typically a group task, but the topic itself can be pretty much anything you can think of. They can be super serious and technical, kind of like a case comp all the way down to more open ended desert island style questions. 

The usual format is a short presentation by the company, followed by the brief. Then as a team you will work together to solve the problem, before presenting the solution at the end. 

Remember, assessment centres are not about getting the right answer, it’s about the entire process and how you work with your group. Try to have fun. Enthusiasm translates really well throughout the entire application process. 


## Preparation

Preparation is pretty typical to a normal interview. Review the job description, learn a bit about the company, do a few voice warm ups such that the first thing you say isn’t a squeak. 

Most importantly, is to not stress. Get a good night's sleep and get energised. Just like any pro athlete or musician has their pre-performance routine, so should you. Whether that be listening to your favourite song, eating/not eating, self-talk or meditating, do what you need to do to calm your nerves, lock in and get into the zone. Visualise success. 


## How to Succeed

As mentioned, assessment centres are not about the end result, but the entire process. As soon as you meet reception, you should be in game mode. The assessors are always writing notes and watching your interactions. There are many skills the assessment centre measures, which I’ll detail below:



* **Overall Vibe**. I think this is a major point which is super overlooked. How you present yourself and interact with everyone is one of the most important factors. Anyone can put on an act for the 40 min activity, but what about outside of that. Are you friendly, confident, sociable, enthusiastic? How do you treat others?
* **Teamwork**. Duh. This one’s easy to tick off. Contribute to the group, suggest ideas and build off other people’s responses. 
* **Communication**. This is how you communicate with your peers. Can you effectively get your ideas across? Do you sound professional, welcoming and comfortable to work with?
* **Leadership**. Take initiative and come up with a plan. Take the lead on where to go next if discussion comes to a stand still. Encourage the quieter group members to express their ideas to show you’re looking out for the whole team. 
* **Organisation**. The task is timed. Have a time-boxed action plan and share it with the group. Remind the group if they are spending too much time on one thing. Take notes and minutes of the discussions. Another overlooked skill, assessors are looking for who they can rely on. 
* **Presentation Skills**. Be concise, convincing and confident. Practice removing filler words, eye contact and do not waffle. More talking does not equal more presentation skills. 
* **Conflict Resolution**. Often you and your group will disagree. How do you react? Show open-mindedness, respect and flex those conflict resolution skills and come to a mutual understanding. 
* **Attention to Detail**. Ask questions about the brief or your peers if you don’t understand things. Often the brief is intentionally left vague. 


## Don’t Over Do It

Assessment centres are a chance for you to show off your skills and personality, but it is indeed very possible to over do it. 

Do not:



* Dominate the conversation by talking the whole time, 
* Run a dictatorship trying to flaunt your leadership abilities. 
* Be arrogant, stubborn or egotistical defending your ideas
* Put others and their ideas down

Remember you are working as a team, so putting others down only drags you down with them. If the team works well together, then everyone benefits, as everyone looks like a strong candidate.
