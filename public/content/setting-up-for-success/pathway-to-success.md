When you begin to venture into the job searching market, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed, especially if you don’t think you have a perfect academic record, a string of fancy internships, and an unbeatable network. But here’s the truth, you don’t need that. There’s no single “secret formula” for success, and everyone’s journey is unique.


## The Perfect Candidate

It’s tempting to believe that only those with a sky-high WAM, endless achievements, and a massive industry network will succeed. But that’s not reality. Most people who land great jobs don’t tick every box. Instead, they focus on building a broad, well-rounded profile.

**Employers aren’t expecting you to have direct, relevant experience for every role.** What they really want is someone who can do the job - someone adaptable, willing to learn, and able to show their value.


## The Boring (But Effective) Formula

There’s no magic number or key phrase to say. Instead, focus on:



* Embrace yourself and what makes you unique.
* Playing to your strengths and addressing your weaknesses.
* Learning to articulate your worth clearly.
* Putting in the reps.


## Build Yourself a Reputation, Not Just a Resume

You don’t need to be the absolute best in one area. Instead, think of your skills and experiences as stats in a game. The goal is to have the highest total stats, not just max out one. 

For example, a decent WAM plus some casual work and leadership experience is often more valuable than a perfect WAM with nothing else.

**Employers know you’re early in your career.** They’re looking for potential, not perfection.


## Effort vs. Reward: Work Smarter, Not Harder

Not all effort pays off equally. For example, spending hours perfecting a cover letter for a company that doesn’t require one isn’t the best use of your time. Instead, try:



* Using tools (like AI) to draft cover letters, then spend a little extra time personalising them.
* Focusing your energy where it will have the biggest impact - like leaning into your strengths, or improving a weak skill that will give you exponential returns.


## Maximise Your Strengths

Think about what you’re naturally good at, whether it’s academics, socialising, technical skills, or something else. Lean into these. Capitalising on your strengths is often easier and more rewarding than fighting an uphill battle.


## Address Your Weaknesses

Don’t ignore your weak spots. The good news is that improving in an area where you’re starting from scratch can give you huge gains with relatively little effort. Whether it’s networking, interviewing, or organisation, small improvements can lead to big results.


## Know Your Worth (and Learn to Show It)

Every experience counts. Whether it’s a casual job, society involvement, or a group project, you’re building skills employers want - teamwork, leadership, and initiative. The key is to recognise these skills and be able to back them up with real examples.

**Don’t fake it.** Employers can tell when someone is bluffing. Instead, reflect on your genuine experiences, even those outside traditional work or study and draw out the skills you’ve developed.


## Articulate Your Value

Having great skills and experiences is useless if you can’t communicate them. The person who can clearly explain what they’ve learned from a casual job often outshines someone with a flashier resume but poor self-awareness.

**Pro tip:** Quantify your achievements and back up your claims with evidence, not just ticking buzzwords.


## Do the Reps. 

Job hunting is a skill in itself. Don’t expect to nail it on your first try. Every application, interview, and networking event is practice, each one makes you better and more confident.



* Apply widely, even for roles you’re unsure about.
* Treat every opportunity as a chance to learn and improve.


## Year-by-Year Advice

**First Year: \
**Say yes to everything - join societies, attend events, get a job, and build a broad base of experiences.
