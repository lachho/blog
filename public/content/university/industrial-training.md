## What is it?

UNSW requires all engineering students to complete a minimum of 60 days of relevant industrial training (IT) work experience. This means it needs to be an engineering job, where you have an experienced engineer to assist your learning. You must complete IT to get your degree. 

There are 2 main forms:



* **Traditional** - This is just most normal internships conducted over the summer or even part-time during the term. To get one of these, you need to apply as you would normally for any other internship. The school does not assist in finding a placement for you, and all advice on this site should help you get that internship. 
* **Non-Traditional** - Non-traditional placements are student projects, programs or courses at UNSW where you are exposed to engineering related tasks and technical skills. Examples include:
    * ChallENG projects
    * UNSW WIL Courses
    * Taste of Research 
    * Project Everest. 
    * A maximum of 30 days of non-traditional placements can be counted to your total 60-day Industrial Training. Non-Traditional placements can be found in the â€œCareers & Employment Resources'' section on the UNSW Engineering Moodle page


## IT Process

Once you get a job, there is still more work to go. These are relatively easy, but rather tedious. However, I would advise doing them as soon as possible. Your 60 day count only starts after UNSW approves all your forms, which could take weeks. Submit your forms ASAP so every day you work counts. 

Before you start your work:



1. Enrol into UNSW Engineering Industrial Training Moodle course 
2. Complete the 5 pre-requisite modules on Moodle
3. Submit all the forms and documentation to get your workplace approved. 
4. Complete your 60 days. 

After you finish your 60 days



5. Complete and submit Employer Evaluation Form with supervisor 
6. Log your 60 days of work placement 
7. Complete your final Industrial Training report and submit to Moodle.
